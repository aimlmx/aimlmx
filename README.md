<h4 align="left">Mission Statement:</h3>

My work is rooted in my early experience with AmeriCorps VISTA, where I built sustainable data and reporting solutions for nonprofits. That mission-driven foundation continues to shape my passion for using data to advance organizational strategy and strengthen social impact.

I help organizations create trusted, accurate data foundations and transform complex information into clear, actionable insights. My focus is on accuracy, clarity, and scalability, ensuring that analysis supports confident decisions and delivers meaningful results for both organizations and the communities they serve.

I bring a blend of mission-focused insight and technical expertise in SQL Server administration, data modeling, reporting, and analytics. I use tools like SQL and Power BI to connect technical precision with real-world impact.

If you're looking for a data professional committed to solving nonprofit data challenges and building data systems that move organizations forward, I’d welcome the opportunity to connect.
